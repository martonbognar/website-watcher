# Website watcher

Check the content of websites and get notified if one of them changes.

## Configuration

Add your sites to `sites.tsv`. The values are the url of the site you want to check, and the checking interval in minutes, the two separated by a single tab. Feel free to remove the two example sites, do not remove the header row though.

## Running

`python watcher.py`
